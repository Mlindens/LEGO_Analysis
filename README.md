This analysis intends to find the answers to the following questions:

* How many LEGO sets have been released since 1970? Is there a noticable trend?

* Which has been the most popular theme in each decade?

* Is there a relationship between the price of a set and its number of pieces?

* Are LEGO minifigures most closely tied to licensed sets?

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy.
